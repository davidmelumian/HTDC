my solutions to exercises, from How to Design Classes


UPD: I have dropped the book at page 333. Major problems of this book
1)  a draw library does not work, which forces you to skip exercises, because it is impossible to solve them without this library.
2)  From Chapter IV, the way that authors  define classes  with `null` field, does not actually work in Drracket. it gives you an error.
